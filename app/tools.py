        Here's the problem this solves. Sending a message is not like updating a field: if an
        update runs twice you end up in the same place, but if a *send* runs twice the customer
        gets two emails. And calls do get repeated — a retry after a timeout, a duplicated
        request, a bug in a loop. So the tool itself has to refuse to do the work twice.

        The standard fix is an idempotency key: the caller passes a string that identifies THIS
        PARTICULAR send. The tool remembers which keys it has already handled. A repeat of a key
        it has seen returns the original result instead of doing anything.

        The agent already generates a stable key per (run, step) for you — see `_execute` in
        app/agent.py. Your job is the remembering.

        What to do:
          - if `contact_id` or `idempotency_key` is missing, raise ToolError. A key is not
            optional; without one the caller can't be protected.
          - if the contact doesn't exist, raise ToolError (same as update_contact).
          - if `idempotency_key` is already in `self._idem`: return the stored result, but with
            "deduped": True, and do NOT append to self.messages.
          - otherwise: append the message to `self.messages`, build the result, store it in
            `self._idem` under the key, and return it with "deduped": False.
          - the returned dict should include at least "message_id" and "contact_id".

        A message id like f"m_{len(self.messages)}" is fine.

        The test that matters: call it twice with the same key, then assert
        `len(ws.messages) == 1`. Checking the return value alone isn't enough — the bug you're
        guarding against is the second message existing, so assert on the world, not the
        response. Write that test first.
