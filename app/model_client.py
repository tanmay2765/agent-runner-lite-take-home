"""The seam between our code and a foundation model.

We never import a vendor SDK. We define the smallest interface we need (`ModelClient`) and code
against that. A real adapter for Anthropic, OpenAI or Bedrock would implement the same one method.
For this exercise the only implementation is a scripted mock, so everything runs offline with no
API keys, no network, and no cost — and every test gives the same answer every time.

    Networks and model providers are unreliable. Some failures are worth retrying and some are
    not, and telling them apart is the whole skill here.

    What to do:
      - call `model.complete(messages)` and return its text on success.
      - on ThrottleError: wait, then try again — up to `settings.model_max_retries` retries.
        Sleep `settings.model_backoff_base_seconds * (2 ** attempt)` before each retry, where
        `attempt` starts at 0. That doubling is called exponential backoff: if the provider is
        overloaded, hammering it every 10ms makes things worse for everyone, so each wait is
        longer than the last.
      - if the retries run out, let the last ThrottleError propagate. Don't swallow it and don't
        return None — the caller needs to know this failed.
      - on FatalError (and any other exception): raise straight away, no retry.

    Use `time.sleep` — this whole service is synchronous, there's no async here.

    Test it by scripting the mock:
        MockModelClient([ThrottleError("429"), ThrottleError("429"), '{"intent":"final","answer":"hi"}'])
      → returns the JSON, and `model.calls == 3`
        MockModelClient([FatalError("bad key"), '{"intent":"final","answer":"hi"}'])
      → raises FatalError, and `model.calls == 1` (this is the assertion that proves you did NOT
        retry the fatal error — a test that only checks "it raised" would pass even if you
        retried three times first)

    Write those two tests before you write the function.
