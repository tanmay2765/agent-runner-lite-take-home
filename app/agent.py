"""The agent loop. This is the centrepiece of the exercise.

An "agent" here is not magic. It's a loop:

    ask the model what to do  →  do it  →  tell the model what happened  →  repeat

…until the model says it's finished, or we run out of turns. Everything else in this project exists
to make that loop safe: the gate decides whether a step is allowed, the verifier checks afterwards
that the right things happened, the retry keeps a flaky provider from killing the run.

PROVIDED: AgentDeps, and the helpers `_decide`, `_emit`, `_ask_reviewer`, `_execute`, `_observation`.

    Do this AFTER tasks 1, 2 and 4 — this function calls all of them, and it's far easier to debug
    a loop when the pieces it uses are already tested.

    The helpers below do the fiddly parts. Read all five before you start; roughly two thirds of
    this function is calling them in the right order.

    ── The shape of it ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        task = deps.store.get_task(run.task_id)
        messages = [system prompt, then the task goal as a user message]
        writes_done = 0
        run.status = "running"

        for _ in range(deps.settings.max_steps):

            1. DECIDE. intent = _decide(deps, messages)
               If it's None the model never produced valid JSON: emit an "error" step, set
               run.status = "failed" and run.error, and stop.

            2. FINISHED? If intent.intent == "final": emit a "final" step carrying
               intent.answer, set run.status = "completed", and break out of the loop.

            3. FIND THE TOOL. tool = deps.registry.get(intent.tool)
               If it isn't there, this is a hallucinated tool name. Do NOT crash and do NOT fail
               the run — emit a "tool_result" step with ok=False, append an observation saying the
               tool is unknown, and `continue`. The model gets to try something else. This is the
               single most common reason a real agent loop falls over, and the `unknown_tool`
               scenario exists so you can prove yours doesn't.

            4. GATE IT. decision = evaluate_gate(run.autonomy, tool.kind, writes_done,
                                                 deps.settings.max_auto_writes)
               Emit a "gate" step recording decision.reason — this is the audit trail.

               If decision.requires_approval:
                   approved = _ask_reviewer(task, run, deps)
                   If not approved: emit a failed "tool_result", append an observation saying the
                   reviewer declined, and `continue`. A rejection is not a crash — the run carries
                   on and the model can do something else or finish.

            5. RUN IT. result, ok = _execute(tool, intent.args, run, decision.simulate)
               Emit a "tool_call" step and a "tool_result" step.

               If ok and tool.kind == "write":
                   append an Effect to run.effects — tool name, the args used, and
                   simulated=decision.simulate — and increment writes_done. Both halves matter:
                   the Effect is what the verifier reads, and writes_done is what the gate's
                   budget counts.

               An unsuccessful tool call (ok is False, meaning it raised ToolError) is NOT fatal
               either. Feed it back like the unknown tool and carry on.

            6. TELL THE MODEL. messages.append({"role": "user",
                                                "content": _observation(result)})

        If the loop runs to its limit without a "final", the model never finished: emit an "error"
        step and set run.status = "failed". Do not leave the status as "running" — a caller polling
        this run would wait forever.

        Wrap the whole thing in try/except. A FatalError from the model, or any unexpected
        exception, should mark the run "failed" with the message in run.error rather than escaping
        to the caller. An agent runner that 500s when a provider rejects a key isn't finished.

        Finally, if the run completed: run.verdict = verify(task, run). Then return run.

    ── What we're looking for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The theme running through all of the above: a tool that doesn't exist, a tool that errors, and
    a reviewer who says no are all NORMAL. They're observations, fed back to the model. Only two
    things end a run — the model saying it's done, or something genuinely unrecoverable.

    Every branch emits a Step. Afterwards, `run.steps` should read like a transcript of what
    happened and why each write was permitted.

    ── Tests worth writing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      - the "default" scenario completes with no tool calls and no effects
      - "send_followup" under `autonomous` completes, records exactly one effect, and passes
        verification when the task expects that message
      - the same scenario under `shadow` records the effect with simulated=True, still passes
        verification, and leaves `deps.workspace.messages` EMPTY (nothing really happened —
        assert on the workspace, not just the effect list)
      - "unknown_tool" completes rather than raising
      - "three_writes" under `autonomous` with max_auto_writes=1 → the later writes are gated
      - "never_finishes" ends with status "failed" and does not hang
      - "bad_credentials" ends with status "failed" and does not raise out of run_agent
